    <h2> Mother</h2>
    <p>A mother is the female parent of a child. Mothers are women 
        who inhabit or perform the role of bearing some relation to 
        their children, who may or may not be their biological offspring.
        Thus, dependent on the context, women can be considered mothers 
        by virtue of having given birth, by raising their child(ren), 
        supplying their ovum for fertilisation, or some combination thereof.
        Such conditions provide a way of delineating the concept of motherhood,
        or the state of being a mother. Women who meet the third and first 
        categories usually fall under the terms 'birth mother' or 
        'biological mother', regardless of whether the individual in question 
        goes on to parent their child. Accordingly, a woman who meets only 
        the second condition may be considered an adoptive mother, and
        those who meet only the first or only the third a surrogacy mother.</p>
