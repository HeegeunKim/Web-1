    <h2> Father</h2>
    <p>A father is the male parent of a child. Besides the paternal bonds of 
        a father to his children, the father may have a parental, legal, 
        and social relationship with the child that carries with it certain rights 
        and obligations. An adoptive father is a male who has become the child's
         parent through the legal process of adoption. A biological father is 
         the male genetic contributor to the creation of the infant, through sexual 
         intercourse or sperm donation. A biological father may have legal obligations 
         to a child not raised by him, such as an obligation of monetary support. 
         A putative father is a man whose biological relationship to a child is alleged
          but has not been established. A stepfather is a male who is the husband of 
          a child's mother and they may form a family unit, but who generally does not 
          have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child.

        The adjective "paternal" refers to a father and comparatively to "maternal" for 
        a mother. The verb "to father" means to procreate or to sire a child from which
         also derives the noun "fathering". Biological fathers determine the sex of their 
         child through a sperm cell which either contains an X chromosome (female), or 
         Y chromosome (male).[1] Related terms of endearment are dad (dada, daddy), baba,
          papa, pappa, papasita, (pa, pap) and pop. A male role model that children can 
          look up to is sometimes referred to as a father-figure.
