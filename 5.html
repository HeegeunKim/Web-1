    <h2> Doughter</h2>
    <p>A daughter is a female offspring- a girl or woman in relation
         to her parents. Daughterhood is the state of being someone's
          daughter. The male counterpart is a son. Analogously the name 
          is used in several areas to show relations between groups or 
          elements. The word daughter also has several other connotations 
          attached to it, one of these being used in reference to female 
          descendancy or consanguinity. It can also be used as a term of 
          endearment coming from an elder.</p>
